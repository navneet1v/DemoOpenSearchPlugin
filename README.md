## DemoOpenSearchPlugin
As the name suggest this is a Demo Plugin for OpenSearch. I am using this to project to provide demos to my team on various plugin features. The examples provided in this plugin are not production ready and should only be used as a reference.

### Things to keep in mind:
1. The code is not production ready and only for demo purpose.
2. As the time progress the examples can become outdated, so don't curse me on this.
3. As a owner of this repo I will try to update the examples with the latest interfaces, but as you know everyone has limited time so there can be delays.
4. Don't raise issues in this repo and start any discussion because as this is not an official OpenSearch repo. Try to use the [OpenSearch Forum](https://forum.opensearch.org/) for all your questions.
